# Tel Aviv Facebook Rental Scraper

> A Manifest V3 Chrome extension that scrapes Tel Aviv apartment rental listings from Facebook groups, classifies them with a local regex pipeline, and presents them in a filterable dashboard — so you can actually find a flat without drowning in posts.
>
> Vibe-coded with Claude (https://claude.ai) by Anthropic.

## Features

- **One-click scraping** — open any Facebook group or feed, click *Scrape This Feed* in the popup, and the extension auto-scrolls and captures posts. Configurable stop conditions (N consecutive duplicates, or a time limit). A continuation banner lets you push past the stop point for 50 more posts or 5 more minutes.
- **Local-only classification** — every captured post runs through `lib/regex_extractor.js`, a Hebrew/English regex pass that catches `להשכרה`, `שכירות`, `for rent`, monthly-price patterns, and the inverse (`למכירה`, `for sale`). There is no remote API in the loop. Posts the regex can't classify with confidence stay unlabeled until a human handles them.
- **Structured tag extraction** — for rental posts, the extractor pulls: price (₪/mo), rooms, size (m²), entry date, whether it's a roommate listing, and whether a broker fee applies.
- **See-more expansion** — Facebook collapses long posts with a "See more" / "ראה עוד" button. The scroller clicks them before extraction so the full text ends up in the database (not a 250-char preview).
- **Marketplace cross-posts** — Marketplace listings (`/commerce/listing/`, `/marketplace/item/`) that appear in groups are captured too, with their own post-ID prefixes (`cl_…`, `mp_…`).
- **In-group permalink preference** — on a specific group page, the extractor rejects cross-card pollution (Recommended Reels, links to other groups) and only accepts permalinks that match the current group or are Marketplace listings.
- **Filterable dashboard** — sort by scraped/posted date, price, or rooms; filter by status, label, label source, days posted, days scraped, free-text search, price range, rooms range, roommates, broker fee, entry-date range, duplicates visibility.
- **Human-in-the-loop corrections** — correct any label or tag via the inline editor. Corrections are stored as `tags_human_override` in IndexedDB.
- **Deduplication** — posts are fingerprinted on save (SHA-256 of normalised text + first image URL). A duplicate inherits the original's classification so we don't redo work on identical content.
- **Mark as duplicate** — manually flag cross-posted listings the hash doesn't catch. They drop out of the default view; toggle *Duplicates* in the sidebar to see them again.
- **Permanent delete** — a trash button on each card. Deleted posts come back if Facebook still shows them on a future scrape — there's no permanent blocklist.
- **Auto-scrape URL parameter** — appending `?tlv_auto_scrape=1` to a Facebook URL starts a 30-minute scrape automatically after a 4-second render delay. Useful for scheduled-task workflows.
- **Export JSON** — dump every IndexedDB record to a JSON file for backup or external analysis.

## Architecture

Facebook feed → content scripts (`extractor.js` + `scroller.js` + `content.js`) → service worker (`background.js`) → IndexedDB.

`background.js` is the only place that:
- Writes the extension's IndexedDB (content scripts run at `facebook.com` origin and would write Facebook's storage instead)
- Runs `lib/regex_extractor.js` against incoming posts and saves the result

Classification is fully synchronous from the content script's perspective — by the time `SAVE_POST` returns, the post is dedup'd, classified, and saved.

## Prerequisites

- **Chrome** or any Chromium-based browser that supports Manifest V3 (Edge, Arc, Brave).

No API keys. No external services. No network traffic.

   git clone https://github.com/ablolarof/tel-aviv-facebook-scraper.git
   ```
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right corner toggle).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the repository folder.
5. The 🏠 TLV Rentals icon appears in your toolbar.

## Usage

### Scraping

1. Navigate to a Facebook group or feed.
2. Click the 🏠 icon and press **Scrape This Feed**.
3. The extension auto-scrolls and captures posts until it hits the configured stop condition (default: 30 consecutive duplicates or 5 minutes).
4. Press **■ Stop** at any time. When a stop condition fires, you can **Continue 50 more posts**, **Continue 5 more minutes**, or **Done**.

### Dashboard

Click **Open Dashboard ↗** in the popup (or navigate to `chrome-extension://[id]/dashboard/dashboard.html`).

- **Regex Extract** — runs the local regex extractor on every rental post that hasn't been processed yet. Instant.
- **Rental / Not rental** buttons — override the auto-label. Marking a post as rental triggers regex tag extraction inline.
- **✏ Edit tags** — correct any extracted field, or change the classification. Corrections are stored as `tags_human_override` in IndexedDB.
- **Show more / Show less** — long card text is line-clamped to 3 lines; click to expand. Expanded state persists across re-renders.
- **⊘ Dupe** — toggle a post's duplicate flag manually.
- **🗑 Delete** — permanently remove a post. It will be re-scraped if it still appears on Facebook.
- **Export JSON** — download every IndexedDB record as a JSON file.

### Auto-scrape via URL parameter

Append `?tlv_auto_scrape=1` to any Facebook URL and the content script will start a 30-minute scrape automatically after a 4-second render delay.

## Roadmap

1. **Dashboard "regex missed" mechanism.** *(In progress.)* Mark a post as a regex miss, record the key phrase that proves the correct answer, export as a training prompt, apply regex fixes, re-test, clear resolved flags.
2. **Fix the Open button.** Currently only links correctly when the post URL contains `/commerce/listing/`.
3. **Improve duplicate detection.** Fuzzier signal than text+image SHA-256.
4. **Fix the group-name capture bug.** Some group names come through truncated.
